Computer vision based framwork for  player tracking and analysis in football videos

Football is one of the most followed sports across the world,in recent years there has been as increasing interest in sport analytics side of this sport. In this project i aim to do Computer Vision based analysis. I was heavily influenced by the ideas given in this [article](https://medium.com/@nicolo.lucchesi?p=745e62b36295)<br>

**Note**: The videos used for making the labelled dataset was from this [paper](https://datasets.simula.no/alfheim/), please make sure to download this dataset, and create a directory structure of the format before running the concatanate_video.py file
> video_dataset/SVPPD/<all the video files>
