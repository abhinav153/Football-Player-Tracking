Deep Learning based framwork for player tracking and analysis in football videos

Football is one of the most followed sports across the world,in recent years there has been as increasing interest in sport analytics side of this sport. In this project i aim to do Computer Vision based analysis. I was heavily influenced by the ideas given in this [article](https://medium.com/@nicolo.lucchesi?p=745e62b36295)<br>

Dataset used:[Soccer video & Position dataset](https://datasets.simula.no/alfheim/)

## Literature review
1. [Bring it to the Pitch: Combining Video and Movement Data to
Enhance Team Sport Analysis - 2018](https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/18380/8/paper319.pdf)

## Aims
1. Using homography to <br>
  1.1 Create panoramic views<br>
  1.2 Projecting cuurent video frame to panoramic view<br>
  1.3 Projecting current video frame to to 2d pitch representation
3. Try out various player tracking approaches to identify player positions on the 2d homagraphic pitch view
4. Calculate various football analysis metric possible,like<br>
  4.1 Player trajectories<br>
  4.2 Team structure<br>

### 1. Using Homographic projections
   First step is to be able to create a panoramic view of the live football video stream.<br>
   

### 2. Use a custom model for identifying players, and mapping to a live 2d pitch system

### 3. Calculate metric based on identified player positions
